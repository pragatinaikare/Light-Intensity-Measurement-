# Light-Intensity-Measurement-

Light Intensity measurement to control the switching on and off of the light in the Home Automation system. LDR sensor is the photoresistor that plays a major role in the Light Intensity Measurement circuit.

Create an embedded solution with Arduino which can measure the light intensity, with this Intensity of light can be easily measured using Arduino, LED, LDR, Resistor, Breadboard etc.

●	TinkerCAD circuit simulation software - It is an online simulation software used for circuit design. It has all the electrical components required to built circuits and runs them.

System Description

When the LDR is connected, the LED is initially OFF and the multimeter shows no reading. When the intensity of light on the surface of the LDR increases, the resistance of the semiconducting material present on the surface of the LDR decreases according to the principle of photoconductivity. This changes the voltage level also. 


The voltage is given to the LED as input and based on the value transmitted, the LED glows/dims. The change in brightness of the LED indicates the light intensity. The same voltage output value is shown on the multimeter and the Serial monitor of Arduino.
